HSA Simulator

----Build Instructions----

The simulator and tests can be built with clang or gcc.

To build a native version:
- Create a build directory: (for example, build_linux)
    mkdir build_linux
- Go to that directory :
    cd build_linux
- Generate make file with cmake:
    cmake [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = <Debug| Release>] <path/to/project/dir>
- Build the project with make:
    make

To build a 32-bit on 64-bit platforms:
- Create build directory, for example build_linux
    mkdir build_linux
- Go to that directory :
    cd build_linux
- Generate make file with cmake:
    CFLAGS="-m32" CXXFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32" cmake [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = <Debug| Release>] <path/to/project/dir>
- Build the project with make:
    make

----System Requirements----

Building the simulator requires cmake, cc, c++, make, git, svn, libelf, and
libdwarf.

Running the simulator requires SSE3 support, libelf, and libdwarf.

----Validated Platforms----

The primary environment for the HSA Simulator project is a modern POSIX-based
operating system. The HSA Simulator has been tested on CentOS 5 and 6 and Ubuntu
12.04 and 12.10. For each operating system, the simulator has been validated on
i386 and x86-64 architectures in both release and debug builds. The HSA
simulator has been compiled and tested with gcc 4.1, gcc 4.4, gcc 4.5, gcc 4.6,
gcc 4.7, gcc 4.8, and clang 3.2. All supported operating systems pass our tests
using their default compiler.

----Testing the simulator----

Building the HSA simulator will generate nine test cases. The two most important
tests are brig_reader_test and brig_runtime_test. Both are based on
gtest. brig_runtime_test tests individual instructions for on a wide array of
inputs. brig_runtime_test contains several long-running test cases that are
disabled by default. Depending on the host, these tests can take between hours
and days. To enable these tests run brig_runtime_test with the --gtest_filter=*
option. brig_reader_test tests instructions and kernels in the context of a full
HSA simulation. If both brig_reader_test and brig_runtime_test pass, the
simulator is probably working correctly.

The remaining tests are more idiosyncratic.

barrierTest - tests the barrier instructions

brig_reader_test - tests interoperability between assembler and
    simulator. Starting with HSAIL, the brig_reader_test assembles the programs
    to BRIG, then simulates the programs for various test inputs to ensure
    semantic consistency.

brig_runtime_test - Verifies each instruction has been implemented in accordance
    with the HSA PRM using automatic test vector generation

debug - tests the HSA runtime debug interface

fcos - a stand-alone application that reports the the cos of angles form -pi
    radians to pi radians at half pi intervals. Due to rounding error the cosine
    of pi/2 is reported as a very small negative number instead of zero.

fib - a recursive Fibonacci implementation based on an example in the HSA
    PRM. This program demonstrates correct scoping for argument variables and
    recursion.

hsa_runtime_test - Tests the implementation of the HSA runtime API

vectorCopy - performs a vector copy using the HSA simulator

----Simulator Utilities----

Building the simulator generates two utilities. These utilities are used to aid
debugging and will not interest most users.

brig_validate - Takes a brig file as an argument. If the brig is not valid
prints an error message explaining the problems.

dumpDebugInfo - Takes a brig file as an argument. Attempts to dump the debug
information. The output file will have the same name as the input file with
.debuginfo appended.

----High-level Design Overview----

The design of the simulator can be broken into four major components: the ELF
reader, the BRIG façade, the LLVM code generator, and the BRIG
runtime. Deserializing is handled by the ELF reader class. To facilitate code
generation, there are a variety of BRIG façade classes. Each BRIG façade class
interprets BRIG directly without modifying or copying it. The façade merely
provides a convenient and object oriented abstraction on top of the underlying
BRIG data structures. The LLVM code generator uses the methods provided by the
façade to generate corresponding LLVM code. Control-flow is replicated directly
in the LLVM code, but each HSAIL instruction is simulated by a function
implemented in the BRIG runtime. The BRIG runtime is implemented in C++ to allow
rapid development and extensive validation for individual instructions.

----ELF Reader----

src/brig2llvm/brig_reader.cc - implements the BrigReader class for deserializing
BRIG from ELF files. BrigReader has no public constructor, but can be generated
by either of two public static methods taking either a file name or a buffer and
a length. Once a BrigReader is constructed successfully, each BRIG section can
be retrieved by an accessor method (getDirectives(), getCode(), getOperands(),
getDebug(), or getStrings()). The BrigReader class will accept multiple ELF
section names (.brig_directives or .directives) in order to accommodate
variation found in the ELF encoded BRIG files supplied by AMD.

----BRIG Façade----

src/brig2llvm/brig_module.cc - Implements the BrigModule class. The BrigModule
class represents an entire program includes extensive validation code to ensure
the input is valid. BrigModule has two pairs of public iterators:

    BrigFunction begin() const;
    BrigFunction end() const;

    BrigSymbol global_begin() const;
    BrigSymbol global_end() const;

    The first pair iterates over functions and the second of global variables.

src/brig2llvm/brig_function.cc - The BrigFunction class represents functions.

    // Get the name of the function
    const char *getName() const;

    // Get the number of arguments
    uint32_t getNumArgs() const;

    // Is the function a declaration?
    bool isDeclaration() const;

    // Get the linkage type
    BrigAttribute getLinkage() const;

    // Is the function a kernel?
    bool isKernel() const;

    // Is the function not a kernel?
    bool isFunction() const;

    // Iterate over function arguments
    BrigSymbol arg_begin() const;
    BrigSymbol arg_end() const;

    // Iterate over local variables in the function (scope is regenerated
    // elsewhere)

    BrigSymbol local_begin() const;
    BrigSymbol local_end() const;

    // Iterate over control blocks aka super blocks
    // A control block is a single-entry multiple-exit code region.
    // By contrast a basic block is a single-entry single-exit code region.
    BrigControlBlock begin() const;
    BrigControlBlock end() const;

    // Iterate over all of the scopes in a function. Variables declared in an
    // inner scope cannot be accessed in other scopes. HSA does not allow nested
    // scopes.
    BrigScope scope_begin() const;
    BrigScope scope_end() const;

src/brig2llvm/brig_symbol.cc - The BrigSymbol class representing global
variables, local variables, and arguments

    // Get the name of a symbol, since names are not unique, this method is only
    // used for generating debug information
    const char *getName() const;

    // Get the storage class
    BrigStorageClass getStorageClass() const;

    // Get the linkage type
    BrigAttribute getLinkage() const;

    // Check for various attributes
    bool isConst() const;
    bool isArray() const;
    bool isFlexArray() const;

    // Get the array dimensions if this is an array
    uint32_t getArrayDim() const;

    // Get the type of the symbol
    BrigDataType getType() const;

    // Check whether this is an image, sampler, or symbol
    bool isImage() const;
    bool isSampler() const;
    bool isSymbol() const;

    // Is there a static initializer?
    bool hasInitializer() const;

    // Return a constant pointer to the initialization data.
    // The pointer should NOT be free'd or delete'd
    template<class T> const T *getInit() const;

src/brig2llvm/brig_control_block.cc - represents a control block

    // Get the name of the control block to generate debug information
    const char *getName() const;

    // iterate over instructions in each control block
    inst_iterator begin() const;
    inst_iterator end() const;

src/brig2llvm/brig_scope.cc - represents a scope with a function

    // Get the offsets into the code section corresponding to the start and end
    // of the scope
    uint32_t getCodeScopeStart() const;
    uint32_t getCodeScopeEnd() const;

    // Get the offsets into the directives section corresponding to the start
    // and end of the scope
    uint32_t getDirScopeStart() const; uint32_t
    getDirScopeEnd() const;

include/brig_util.h - a variety of utility methods for iterating over BRIG
data-structures (dir_iterator, inst_iterator, and oper_iterator)

src/brig2llvm/brig_inst_helper.cc - various methods for inspecting instructions

----LLVM Codegen----

src/brig2llvm/brig2llvm.cc - implements the BrigProgram class for converting
BRIG to LLVM. The BrigProgram class employs the iterators and utility methods in
the façade classes to walk the entire BRIG program and generate appropriate
LLVM. Almost all instructions are implemented as calls to functions implemented
in the BRIG runtime by the runOnComplexInst function. The exceptions are the
brn, call, cbr, and ret instructions, which are implemented directly in
LLVM. The runOnCB method converts from control blocks in the BRIG code to basic
blocks for LLVM. The isSRet method handles descrepancies between the x86 and
86-64 calling conventions. If new target platforms are added, this method may
will need to be enhanced.

src/brig2llvm/brig_engine.cc - glue code to dynamically compile the LLVM at
runtime and spawn an appropriate number of threads

----BRIG Runtime----

src/brig2llvm/brig_runtime.cc - provides a C++ implementation for each HSAIL
instruction. This code makes extensive use of macros and templates in order
generate large numbers of similar instructions from a single implementation

src/brig2llvm/s_fma.c - a high precision implementation of fused-multiply-add
borrowed from FreeBSD under the BSD license. Our testing determined that the fma
implementation in older versions of glibc was insufficiently accurate to meet
the requirements of the HSA specification.

----Environment Variables----

SIMNOOPT - For better GDB debugging experience, the user should define the
environment variable SIMNOOPT. When SIMNOOPT is defined, code optimization will
be disabled to facilitate debugging with GDB. In other situations, the user
might want to unset SIMNOOPT for better performance. Debugging without defining
the SIMNOOPT variable may result in instructions appearing to execute out of
order relative to the original HSAIL program. Conceptually, SIMNOOPT is
equivalent to passing -O0 to a compiler. Since code optimization takes time,
SIMNOOPT may improve performance when optimization time dominates execution
time.

SIMTHREADS - By default the simulator will create approximately as many threads
to process workitems as there are cores on the host system. This can complicate
things while debugging under gdb. If you set SIMTHREADS=1, only a single thread
will be used to process workitems. SIMTHREADS can be set to other values to
use a specific number of threads at runtime.

----GDB-Based Debugging Interface---

The simulators GDB-based debugging interface supports printing and modifying
local variables, registers, and arguments. Here is an example debugging session:

$ gdb ./fib
Reading symbols from /home/tjablin/hsa-workspace/hsail2brig-objects/fib...done.
(gdb) break fib
Function "fib" not defined.
Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y
Breakpoint 1 (fib) pending.
(gdb) run
Starting program: ./fib
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".
Fib sequence: [New Thread 0x7ffff6bb9700 (LWP 1752)]
[Switching to Thread 0x7ffff6bb9700 (LWP 1752)]

Breakpoint 1, fib (n=@0x7ffff6bb8810: 1, r=@0x7ffff6bb8814: 0) at hsail2brig/test/fib.hsail:13
13        ld_arg_s32 $s1, [%n];
(gdb) p n
$1 = (s32 &) @0x7ffff6bb8810: 1
(gdb) p hsa$s1
$2 = {b32 = 0, f32 = 0}
(gdb) n
14        cmp_lt_b1_s32 $c1, $s1, 3; // if n < 3 go to return
(gdb) p hsa$s1
$3 = {b32 = 1, f32 = 1.40129846e-45}
(gdb) n
15        cbr $c1, @return;
(gdb) p hsa$c1
$4 = false

Implementation notes:

* Registers are named hsa$<RegName>, eg. hsa$s1, hsa$d4

* In order to ensure that registers have their proper values at all times,
stores to the simulated register file are now marked volatile. This may slightly
harm simulator performance.

* If a function includes a code block before the first instruction and gdb is
set to break on the line number of the first instruction, then the simulator
will break twice, once before entering the code block and once after entering
the code block. On the first breakpoint, local variables inside the code block
will be out of scope. On the second breakpoint, the local variables inside the
code block will be in scope.

* The type of the $c registers is boolean

* The type of the $s registers is the union of an unsigned 32-bit value and a
float

* The type of the $d registers is the union of an unsigned 64-bit value and a
double

* The type of the $q registers is an unsigned 128-bit value

* The arguments to HSA functions are reference types.

* Before executing the first instruction of a function, the value of all HSA
registers is non-deterministic, as per the HSA specification. After the last
breakpoint before the first instruction, but before the first instruction
executes, the simulator sets all registers to zero. Consequently, breaking on a
function, modifying a register, and then executing the first instruction, will
not have the desired effect.
