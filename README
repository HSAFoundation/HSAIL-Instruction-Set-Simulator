-- HSAIL Simulator Build Instruction --
The simulator and tests can be built with clang or gcc.

To build 64-bit versions:
- Create a build directory: (for example, build_linux)
    mkdir build_linux
- Go to that directory :
    cd build_linux
- Generate make file with cmake:
    cmake [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = <Debug| Release>] <path/to/project/dir>
- Build the project with make:
    make

To build 32-bit versions:
- Create build directory, for example build_linux
    mkdir build_linux
- Go to that directory :
    cd build_linux
- Generate make file with cmake:
    CFLAGS="-m32" CXXFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32" cmake [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = <Debug| Release>] <path/to/project/dir>
- Build the project with make:
    make
