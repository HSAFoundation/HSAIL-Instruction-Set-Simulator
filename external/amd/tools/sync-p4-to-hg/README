How to use the sync-p4-to-hg tool:

- Look at the files-to-sync file.  Each line contains pairs of paths.  The first one is the perforce depot path to the file.  The second one is the destination path to the mercurial repository.
- cd to the directory where the second column files are rooted at.
- This should be $ROOT/external/amd.

Now run:

tools/sync-p4-to-hg/runme

This should run:
tools/sync-p4-to-hg/sync-p4-to-hg -param=tools/sync-p4-to-hg/files-to-sync

that would do the job.
