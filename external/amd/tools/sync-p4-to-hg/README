How to use the sync-p4-to-hg tool:

- Look at the files-to-sync file.  Each line contains pairs of paths.  The first one is the perforce depot path to the file.  The second one is the destination path to the mercurial repository.
- observe the file p4-sync-to-hg-cron-job to make sure that the paths are correct

Now run:

p4-sync-to-hg-cron-job

or install it as a cron job to run whenever you want.

that would do the job.
